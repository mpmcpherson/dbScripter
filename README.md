# dbScripter
random value and db scripts for inserting those values into a database.  

Just whacking together a little group of scripts to help dump text files into the database, as well as randomly generate some data and lay it off to the DB.

I created this since I always get hung up in the slog of things when I'm prototyping: "ugh, I need to either *have* users or write a whole bunch placeholder code." That shit kills me, so I figured I'd just....make the machine do it. And thus.
